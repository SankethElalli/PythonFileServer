# QR Code File Server

This project sets up a simple HTTP server that serves an HTML page displaying file_server folder to access files on the phone. 
Generate and Scan the QR code with a phone allows access to the files on the server. 
The QR code redirects to the server's IP address. 
Move the files that are to be shared or accessed to the server folder before scanning.
